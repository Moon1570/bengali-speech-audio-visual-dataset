### 1. Calibrate your silence threshold dynamically

Instead of hard-coding

```python
silence_thresh = audio_seg.dBFS - 16
```

you can analyze the distribution of your audio’s amplitude and pick a threshold at, say, the 5th percentile of non-zero RMS values:

```python
# compute frame-by-frame RMS
frame_ms = 20
rms_values = [chunk.rms for chunk in audio_seg[::frame_ms]]
# pick a low percentile
silence_thresh = AudioSegment.rms_to_dBFS(
    np.percentile([v for v in rms_values if v > 0], 5)
)
```

This way, “silence” is always tuned to the actual background level in each file.

### 2. Pre-process with noise reduction

Quiet recordings often suffer from a very low-level hiss or room tone that makes true silence look “non-silent.” Running a noise-reduction pass first will:

1. Estimate the noise profile (e.g. using the first few seconds).
2. Suppress that profile from the entire clip.

You can use the [`noisereduce`](https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/) library:

```python
import noisereduce as nr
import numpy as np

# load raw samples
samples = np.array(audio_seg.get_array_of_samples(), dtype=float)
# take first 500 ms as "noise only"
noise_sample = samples[: int(audio_seg.frame_rate * 0.5)]
# reduce noise
reduced = nr.reduce_noise(y=samples, y_noise=noise_sample, sr=audio_seg.frame_rate)
# rebuild AudioSegment
audio_seg = AudioSegment(
    reduced.astype(np.int16).tobytes(),
    frame_rate=audio_seg.frame_rate,
    sample_width=audio_seg.sample_width,
    channels=audio_seg.channels,
)
```

After that, your silence detector will see the floor drop closer to zero.

### 3. Switch to a Voice Activity Detector

pydub’s energy‐based split is simple but fragile at low levels. A more robust alternative is [WebRTC’s VAD](https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad):

```python
import webrtcvad

vad = webrtcvad.Vad(2)  # Aggressiveness: 0–3
frames = frame_generator(30, audio_seg)  # 30 ms frames
segments = vad_collector(audio_seg.frame_rate, 30, 300, vad, frames)

# segments will be lists of (start_ms, end_ms) where speech is detected
```

You can then invert those to find silences, or directly use the speech segments as your “chunks.”

### 4. Combine multiple features

Silence isn’t just low volume—often it has:

* **Low zero-crossing rate**
* **High spectral flatness**
* **Low spectral centroid**

You can compute these with `librosa` and build a simple rule or small ML model that flags “silence” when *all* of these metrics are below their respective thresholds. That tends to be far more robust than volume alone.

---

### 5. Post-split smoothing

Even after you split, you may get a lot of tiny fragments if there are brief pauses. To avoid that:

* **Merge** any two chunks separated by less than, say, 250 ms.
* **Discard** chunks shorter than a minimum useful duration (e.g. < 500 ms).

```python
def merge_short_gaps(timestamps, min_gap=0.25):
    merged = []
    prev_start, prev_end = timestamps[0]
    for start, end in timestamps[1:]:
        if start - prev_end < min_gap:
            prev_end = end
        else:
            merged.append((prev_start, prev_end))
            prev_start, prev_end = start, end
    merged.append((prev_start, prev_end))
    return merged
```

---

### Putting it all together

1. **(Optional) Noise reduction** to knock down the floor.
2. **Dynamic threshold** estimation from a low percentile of your frame RMS.
3. **Split on silence** with pydub OR use a **VAD**.
4. **Merge tiny gaps** and **filter out tiny chunks**.

That pipeline will work equally well for a loud street-corner interview or a hushed library reading. Let me know if you’d like code samples for any of these stages!
